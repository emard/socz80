Changes versus Will's original SocZ80

- Removed UART1   (mistake - should put it back)
- Added joystick interfaces
- Added audio one bit control
- Re-routed second SPI to the ADC (should add a new SPI instead)
- Added seven segment display driver
- Added text mode video
- Added video RAM
- Prototype pieces for a turdo switch (like a turbo but backwards)


Memory Map Changes

0x201xxxx routes to the Video RAM (dual ported BRAM)

undefined I/O generates 0xFF not ROM contents

0x80-0x87 - Seven segment display
	     0x80 reads 1  - LogicStart Megawing
             0x81..0x83 are the segments as 8bit masks

0xD8-0xDF - Video (see manual)

0xE8-0xEF - I/O device glue
0xE8      - bit 0 is the speaker line, music is a software problem
0xEC      - Joystick 0
0xED      - Joystick 1 (n/c)
0xEE      - Joystick 2 (n/c)
