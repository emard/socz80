- Video Interfaces
   - pass a 12bit pixel stream out ready for better VGA outputs

- TextVGA
   - do we care enough to implement a 3 entry LUT compatible with the
     pixel engine
   - User defined graphics ?

- GPIO
   - register to make switches toggle, level trigger or latched on
     other boards (make it report back mode set so we can report
     toggle always on Logic board)

- VideoMem
   - Use the existing SSRAM slot for text display ?

- Put back 2nd UART always (just wire it to nowhere)

- Might be sensible to have a third SPI for the ADC to avoid confusing
  other code

- Can we make the TX and RX share the same address as in and out on SPI. It
  would hugely clean up the software
